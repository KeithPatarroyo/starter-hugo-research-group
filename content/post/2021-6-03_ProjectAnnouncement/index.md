In this announcement  we will officially kick off the main two endeavors of the project:

1. The GoL combinatorial database construction
2. The Gemini Expedition

In the following post we address a little bit the history of the project and present a brief overview of the main project components.

## The Fundamental Observation

This project has four fundamental sources that come all the way back to the summer of 2020. These are: 1. The Combinatorial theory of evolution and economics, 2. The Wolfram Physics Project, 3. The Empirical theory of Metamathematics and 4. The Game of Life(GoL) cellular automata. Each of them developed separately until April 12 2021, where I was able to develop a framework where they all fit together. This framework allowed me see an unexplored territory and convinced me to start thsi project. Next,  I'll describe each of source's development briefly and the key insight that allowed me to unify all of them.
