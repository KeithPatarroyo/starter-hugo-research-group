abstract: We design a two-dimensional density estimation scheme via diffusion that conserves the first order moments and the total mass in the estimation process. In order to conserve the first order moments and the total mass throughout the time iteration, a non-local boundary condition is imposed to the diffusion operator. A discrete method is realized by using the finite element method where the boundary condition is weakly imposed using Lagrange multipliers that leads to the solution of a saddle point problem. We show some numerical examples in different geometries using FeniCS.
