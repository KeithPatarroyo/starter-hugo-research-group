abstract: The movement of defects plays a crucial role in macroscopic elasticity, in this post we describe a possible path for obtaining large scale elastic phenomena from microscopic rules. For this we investigate rewrite rules on Bravais lattices that move disclination and dislocation defects.This systematic study leads naturally to a discrete description of geometric concepts inside a Bravais Graph, different concepts like curvature, torsion, parallel transport, charts and atlas can all be defined without referencing an embedding space. We hope that this treatment of a “lattice gas of defects” can be used as a possible foundation of elasticity and possibly model complicated phenomena like crack formation or tearing of materials. Finally this framework provides a connection between a mesoscopic description of matter and the spacetime Wolfram model, this might become useful to search for topological defects or quasi-particles inside Wolfram Models.
